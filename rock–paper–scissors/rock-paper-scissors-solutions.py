# This function should be used every time accumulated points are updated
# Create two variables that accumulate the wins of each participant
# Create a loop that iterates while no player reaches the minimum of wins
# necessary to win. Inside the loop solves the play of the
# machine and ask the player's. Compare them and update the value of the variables
# that accumulate the wins of each participant.
